# Goal Oriented Action Planning (GOAP) Simulation

## Description

This project is used to learn / investigate 3 things.

1. CI Pipelines with unity in Github
2. UnitTesting in unity
3. GOAP

The project itself will be a hospital simulation based on Penny de Byl's great course
[Advanced AI For Games with Goal-Oriented Action Planning](https://www.udemy.com/share/102tZO3@jEB0-YGw-NBomhrSJ8DFUO5AX3HkHyMkFge-0Z1AVQncN77FVo1e3KL4apIjw9Of/)
over on Udemy.

As much as I like her courses, I prefer to have a more code centric approach. All these "FindObject" or "FindObjectWithTags" seem to introduce such a strong coupling
between code and scenes.
